>This project came about so I could have a personal portfolio site that demonstrated my coding skills in a more comprehensive way. My business website is geared towards gaining clients, not a job.

# <a name="about"></a> About the Project

I'm extremely pleased with how this came out. All animations are pure CSS, to reduce the load on the browser. Materialize provided so many great components, but I also added some custom CSS for my own styling. I added EmailJS to make the contact form work, which worked extremely well.
